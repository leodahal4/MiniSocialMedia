### Algorithm and Data Structures.


I have tried my best to implement this project as MVC architecture.\
All the application logic will be on the app directory.\
Each view will have its own respective Controller on the controllers\
directory under app directory.


## Run as

- virtualenv venv \
  source venv/bin/activate \
  pip install -r requirements.txt

> user can login  
> user can view all posts  
> user can view specific post  
> Navbar design for messages, new post and user image
> how many likes already on the post?  

### not done
> user can view specific posts but not the comments associated with those post  
> user cannot comment  
> user cannnot like the post  
> UserController for gettting user details
