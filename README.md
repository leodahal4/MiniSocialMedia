As a final assignment of 

### Algorithm and Data Structures.


I have tried my best to implement this project as MVC architecture.\
All the application logic will be on the app directory.\
Each view will have its own respective Controller on the controllers\
directory under app directory.


## Run as

- virtualenv venv \
  source venv/bin/activate \
  pip install -r requirements.txt
